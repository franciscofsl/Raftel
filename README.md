# Raftel

**Raftel** is a training project. It's a small framework for building .NET Core applications, intended to be reused as a base for developing solutions that follow clean architecture and apply good coding practices.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Serve as a learning environment to apply software development best practices.
- Practice methodologies and principles such as TDD, DDD, Object Calisthenics, and patterns like CQRS and Unit of Work.
- Provide an initial structure that facilitates scalability and code clarity.
- Avoid external library dependencies, favoring pure .NET solutions.

## ✨ Features

- **Reusable foundation**: designed to be the starting point for multiple .NET Core applications.
- **Simple and extensible structure**: clear project organization (`cli/`, `src/`, `tests/`) to support growth.
- **Integrated testing**: with code coverage and continuous integration from the start.
- **Docker-ready development environment**: quickly spin up dependencies like databases with a single command.
- **No external dependencies**: all code is built purely on the .NET platform, without additional frameworks.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [.NET SDK 9.0 or higher](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, but recommended for full development experience)
